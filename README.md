A laser-focused, no-fluff dating-app matching engine in under 150 lines of pure Python.  
Drop it into a backend, adjust a few weights, and let the sparks fly.

## Why you might like it

- Zero external dependencies. Runs on anything that speaks Python 3.10+.
- Clear, hackable scoring logic. All the knobs live at the top of one file.
- Hard filters for deal-breakers, soft scoring for chemistry.
- Built-in demo so you can try it right away.

## Quick start

bash
git clone https://github.com/cp90-pixel/Simple-Matcher.git
cd simple-matcher
python simple_matcher.py


You’ll see matches ranked for a tiny sample crowd. Swap in real profiles by creating `User` objects and handing a list to `make_matches`.

## How it works

| Step | What happens                                                             | File                |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| 1    | Incoming profiles become `User` objects                                  | `simple_matcher.py` |
| 2    | Hard filters knock out obvious non-matches (orientation, age, geography) | `compatibility()`   |
| 3    | Survivors earn a score based on shared interests, age gap, and distance  | `compatibility()`   |
| 4    | Top results come back as `{uid: [(candidate_uid, score), …]}`            | `make_matches()`    |

All math lives in one place, so changing the romance recipe is painless.

## Tweakable knobs

Open the file and you’ll find a block like this:

```python
W_INTERESTS = 0.60   # shared hobbies
W_AGE_GAP   = 0.25   # age compatibility
W_DISTANCE  = 0.15   # geography
MAX_KM      = 50     # search radius
TOP_N       = 5      # results per user
```

Editing those lines is literally product development.

## Extending the engine

* Swap the in-memory list for your favourite database or graph store.
* Log swipe outcomes and plug in a recommender to replace or refine `compatibility()`.
* Inject a trust-and-safety layer before matches go out the door.
* Serve it as a microservice with FastAPI or Flask in five minutes flat.

## Roadmap

* Opt-in personality test module
* Time-decay on stale profiles
* A/B test bench for scoring tweaks
* Async version for large-scale rollouts
